Check Network ACL. Which NACL associated with VPC1Public-1a and VPC1Private-1a? What traffic are allowed with these rules?
    NACLs having 2 inbound and 2 outbound rules:
    100 ALL Traffic ALL ALL 0.0.0.0/0 ALLOW
    * ALL Traffic ALL ALL 0.0.0.0/0 DENY
    Rule number 100 allow traffic from all sources (0.0.0.0/0) with all protocols and all ports.
    Each network ACL also includes a rule whose rule number is an asterisk. This rule ensures that if a packet doesn't match any of the other numbered rules, it's denied. You can't modify or remove this rule.
    Rules are evaluated starting with the lowest numbered rule. As soon as a rule matches traffic, it's applied regardless of any higher-numbered rule that may contradict it.

What is 0.0.0.0/0 in terms of networking?
    0.0.0.0/0 represents all possible IPv4 addresses. We can use it as default traffic route or as all IP address (public access) in SG.

What is "Request Spot instances"? What are the use cases of Spot instances?
    A Spot Instance is an unused EC2 instance that is available for less than the On-Demand price. Because Spot Instances enable you to request unused EC2 instances at steep discounts, you can lower your Amazon EC2 costs significantly.
    Spot Instances are a cost-effective choice if you can be flexible about when your applications run and if your applications can be interrupted. For example, Spot Instances are well-suited for data analysis, batch jobs, background processing, and optional tasks.

What is the Placement group? What are the use cases? Can you span placement group across several AZs?
    Amazon EC2 cluster placement group functionality allows users to group Cluster Compute Instances in clusters – allowing applications to get the low-latency network performance necessary for tightly-coupled node-to-node communication typical of many HPC applications. Cluster Compute Instances also provide significantly increased network throughput both within the Amazon EC2 environment and to the Internet. As a result, these instances are also well suited for customer applications that need to perform network-intensive operations.
    Spread Placement Groups - can span multiple Availability Zones.

What is the termination protection and use case?
    Termination protection prevents an instance from being accidentally terminated by requiring that you disable the protection before terminating the instance.
    It helps to prevent termination of critical instances. Good example Domain Controllers.

What is the difference between CloudWatch monitoring and detailed monitoring?
    By default, your instance is enabled for basic monitoring. You can optionally enable detailed monitoring. After you enable detailed monitoring, the Amazon EC2 console displays monitoring graphs with a 1-minute period for the instance. 
    Basic monitoring data available within 5 minutes.
    Detailed monitoring data available within 1 minutes.

Which tenancy options available for EC2?
    default - Your instance runs on shared hardware.
    dedicated - Your instance runs on single-tenant hardware.
    host - 	Your instance runs on a Dedicated Host, which is an isolated server with configurations that you can control.

What happen? Why we used sudo?
    We installed updates on Amazon Linux 2 instance.
    sudo stands for “super user do!” . I order to install updates we have to elevate privileges to super user level.

What happen?
    We shutted down instance.
